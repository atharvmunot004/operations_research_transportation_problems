# ðŸšš Operations Research â€“ Transportation Problem - Extensive Computational Analysis

This repository implements and compares **classical methods** for solving the **Transportation Problem** in Operations Research:

- **NWCM** â€“ North West Corner Method  
- **LCM** â€“ Least Cost Method  
- **VAM** â€“ Vogelâ€™s Approximation Method  
- **MODI** â€“ Modified Distribution Method (optimization)

It also includes:
- Random problem generation (balanced / unbalanced)
- Logging of results
- Time measurements for each algorithm
- Visualization of solve vs optimize performance (bar charts)

---

## Features
- Generate random supply, demand, and cost matrices (`balanced` or `unbalanced`)
- Compute **initial basic feasible solution (IBFS)** using NWCM, LCM, VAM
- Optimize IBFS using **MODI**
- Record timings (solve & optimize)
- Save results to `.csv` and `.txt`
- Plot performance comparison charts with **Matplotlib**

## Quickstart

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/atharvmunot004/operations_research_transportation_problems.git
   cd operations_research_transportation_problems


2. **Install requirements**

   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib numpy pandas
   ```

3. **Run main**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will:

   * Generate a random problem
   * Solve with NWCM, LCM, VAM
   * Optimize with MODI
   * Save allocations, logs, and summaries in `dataset/`

4. **Plot performance**

   ```bash
   python plot_transport_times.py --csv transportation_results.csv --avg
   ```

   This generates bar charts comparing solve vs optimize times.

## Methods Explained

* **NWCM** â€“ Simple, quick, but may give poor starting solutions.
* **LCM** â€“ Chooses allocations based on the least cost cell greedily.
* **VAM** â€“ Uses penalties (row/col differences) for smarter allocations.
* **MODI** â€“ Optimizes any IBFS to the optimal solution.

---

## Logging

* all the problems are saved in `dataset/`
* Allocations are saved as `.csv` and `.json`
* Each run includes timings for solve and optimize

---

## Roadmap

* Add stepping stone method for optimization
* Extend to larger problem instances with benchmarking
